# Dance Studio Organization Database
## CS 364 - Introduction to Databases
### June 2020 - August 2020

#### About
This project was a final project for CS 364 - Introduction to Databases. We were allowed to work on a project of our choosing with the following requirements:
 - The application should demonstrate the ability to connect to and interact with a relational database.
 - The database is required to have at least five tables, at least three of which must be entities.
 - The database should have data in it. The data may be either real data that has somehow been imported, or fake data that was developed for the purposes of this project.
 - The application should demonstrate the ability to add, update, and delete data. These functions is not needed to be included for every possible table.
 - There should be at least three pieces of funtionality (specifically highlighted and described under "Functionality" in the document) that requires something beyond basic `SELECT-FROM-WHERE` syntax. There must be at least one query that fits into each of the following categories:
    - **Group 1:** aggregate functions, `LIKE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
    - **Group 2:** `HAVING`, `OFFSET`, outer join, joining four or more tables
    - **Group 3:** subqueries, `IN`, set operators, any additional functionality outside of what was discussed in class will likely fall into this category
    
I decided to create my project as a database for management of a dance studio that included information for dancers, groups the dancers were in, routines dancers or groups were part of, the songs the routines were to, the style of dance the routines were, the teachers at the studio, the routines the teachers choreographed, and the styles the teachers taught.
